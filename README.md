### üõ†Ô∏è How the program works
This program provides loans to individuals or companies.
  Both individual customers and companies can benefit from three types of loans.

Loan for individual clients:
- Mortgage credit (APR - Annual Percentage Rate: 10%)
The credit you can receive providing that you use it only to buy real property.
- Consolidation credit (APR: 15%)
The credit you can receive providing that you will use it to repay other credit.
- Consumer credit (APR: 20%)
The credit you can receive provided you aren't using them for your business.


Loan for companies:
- Investment credit (APR: 6%)
The credit you can receive provided you use them to develop your business.
- Working capital credit (APR: 8%)
The credit you can receive provided you use them for settling your current expenses in company.
- Start-up credit (APR: 10%)
The credit you can receive provided you use them to start your business.

For each type of loan, the program goes through a similar path, modified appropriate to the specific of each loan.
The general sketch of the project is illustrated in a block diagram on the miro platform:

### üí¨ Context of the project:
This was my main project from the second semester of my studies.
I developed it as part of a computer programming course.

### üöÄ My motivation:
I decided to take on this project to work on real-life issues. 
Banks play a crucial role in today's world. 
Automating the loan approval process would benefit consultants by saving their time and their employers' money.
